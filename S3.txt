1. S3 - Simple Storage Service

    * Data stored as objects inside buckets

    * Object = Data + Metadata + Key

    * Keys acts like file paths , not folder, these are just prefixes example     
      (folder/myawsbucket/document.txt)

    * Bucket names are unique globally and data is tied to one Region , region in which Bucket is created

2. Versioning -

    * Disabled by default

    * Enabled - Every overwrites creates a new Version ID

    * Suspended - When versioning is disabled, new files have current version as NULL and overwrites 
      with null version,older file version remains as it is but hidden 

    * Deletes -  Adds a Delete Marker , we can delete manually to remove that version

3. Encryption -

    * Amazon S3 applies server-side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level 
      of encryption for all S3 buckets.

    * Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to disk and decrypts it when you download the object

    * Types of Encryption 
    
    Server Side Encryption - 
    
        SSE-S3 - Default (Server side encryption with AWS s3 managed keys)
        SSE-KMS - server side encryption with AWS key management service (helps in auditing and fine grained control)
        DSSE-KMS - Dual layer server side encryption
        SSE-C - Server side encryption using customer provided keys, Customer is responsible for managing keys, if lost AWS has no responsibility (works over HTTPS only , in case of HTTP it rejects)

    Client Side Encryption - 
        
        Client side encryption is encrypting locally then sending it to AWS s3

4. Storage Classes -

    * Standard - Highly available (99.9)
    * Standard Infrequent Access -  Rarely accessed, but needed instantly (99.9)
    * One Zone - Available in one zone (99.5)
    * Intelligent Tiering - For unpredictable access (99.9)
    * Glacier Instant - Archive  (99.9)
    * Glacier Flexible - Takes 1-12 hours for retrieval, For Long Term Archive (99.9)
    * Glacier Deep - Takes 24-48 hours for retrieval, Cheapest (99.9)

5. Access Control -

    * IAM Policies 
    * Bucket Policies
    * Access Control Lists ACL(legacy)
    * Block Public access - default
    * Object Ownership -Bucket owners owns all the objects

6. Networking -

    * Letting EC2 access S3 w/o NAT/Internet - Gateway endpoint - Adds route in the route table 
      pointing to the service, No NAT or IGW needed

    * Interface endpoint - uses ENI inside VPC , paid per hour 

7. Replication -

    * Same Region Replication & Cross Region Replication , Versioning must be enabled on both source 
      and destination

    * Deleting object - Adds Delete Marker 

8. Durability -

    * 11 9's durability across all storage classes

    * Availability depends upon storage class

9. Events & Integrations -

    * Trigger on object create/delete to SNS, SQS, Lambda

10. IAM and S3 -
	
    * EC2 to able to store objects in S3 , we need to attach a Role which gives access to ec2 instance 
      to use S3 service, using this we dont need to store credentials i.e .pem file in ec2 which makes 
      it more secure

    * If S3 access is given to IAM User - The user can have access to AWS Console or cli access to S3

    ** Creating new IAM User and giving EC2 full access - EC2InstanceConnect access is required to SSH 
       from AWS console else it will not allow
