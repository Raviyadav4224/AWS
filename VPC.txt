1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) -

    * A VPC is a logically isolated private network in AWS where you can launch and manage your 
      AWS resources.

    * Think of it as your own data center inside AWS — fully customizable in terms of IP ranges, 
      routing, and security.

    * You define the IP address range using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

    * By default, all resources in a VPC are private — no internet access unless explicitly given.

    * You can have multiple VPCs in the same AWS account and region.

    * Default VPC: Every region comes with one, preconfigured with subnets, internet access, and route tables.

    * VPCs can connect with other VPCs using VPC Peering or Transit Gateway.

2. Subnets -

* Subnets are segments of your VPC’s IP range where you place resources. They help organize and 
  isolate workloads.

    Example:

    VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IPs)

    Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24 → 256 IPs (Public subnet)

    Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24 → 256 IPs (Private subnet)

    * Public Subnet → Has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).

    * Private Subnet → No direct route to the internet (can use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access).

    * Subnets are AZ-specific (one subnet exists in one Availability Zone only).

    ** AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet (first 4 + last 1).

3. Route Tables

    * A Route Table defines how network traffic is directed inside your VPC. Each subnet must be associated with exactly one route table.

    * Contains routes mapping a destination CIDR → target (IGW, NAT Gateway, VPC Peering, etc.).

    * Main Route Table → Default for all subnets unless you create and associate a custom one.

    * Public Subnet Example:

        Destination     Target
        0.0.0.0/0       Internet Gateway
        10.0.0.0/16     Local


        Private Subnet Example:

        Destination     Target
        0.0.0.0/0       NAT Gateway
        10.0.0.0/16     Local

4. NAT Gateway -

    * NAT stands for Network Address Translation. A NAT Gateway lets instances in private subnets access
      the internet for outbound connections (e.g., downloading packages), but prevents inbound connections
      from the internet.

    * Placed in a public subnet and connected to an Internet Gateway.

    * Private instances → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway → Internet.

    * NAT Gateway is managed by AWS (scales automatically, highly available in one AZ).

    * You can also use a NAT Instance (EC2 running NAT software), but that’s legacy and not recommended.

    ** Common misconception: NAT Gateway does handle outbound rules; inbound from the internet is 
       blocked unless it’s part of an established outbound session.

5. NACL (Network Access Control List)

    * A NACL is a stateless firewall at the subnet level that controls inbound and outbound traffic.

    * Stateless → Return traffic must be explicitly allowed.

    * Rules are processed in order, from lowest to highest number.

    * Default NACL → Allows all inbound and outbound traffic.

    * Custom NACL → Denies all traffic until rules are added.

    * Works alongside Security Groups (SGs are stateful and operate at the instance level).

    * Best used for blocking certain IP ranges or additional subnet-level security.

    * Example use case: Block all ICMP (ping) requests from a specific IP at the subnet level.
