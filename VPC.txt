1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) -

  * A VPC is a logically isolated private network in AWS where you can launch and manage your 
    AWS resources.

  * Think of it as your own data center inside AWS — fully customizable in terms of IP ranges, 
    routing, and security.

  * You define the IP address range using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

  * By default, all resources in a VPC are private — no internet access unless explicitly given.

  * You can have multiple VPCs in the same AWS account and region.

  * Default VPC: Every region comes with one, preconfigured with subnets, internet access, and route tables.

  * VPCs can connect with other VPCs using VPC Peering or Transit Gateway.

2. Subnets -

  * Subnets are segments of your VPC’s IP range where you place resources. They help organize and 
    isolate workloads.

      Example:

      VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IPs)

      Subnet 1: 10.0.1.0/24 → 256 IPs (Public subnet)

      Subnet 2: 10.0.2.0/24 → 256 IPs (Private subnet)

      * Public Subnet → Has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).

      * Private Subnet → No direct route to the internet (can use NAT Gateway for outbound internet access).

    * Subnets are AZ-specific (one subnet exists in one Availability Zone only).

    ** AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet (first 4 + last 1).

3. Route Tables

  * A Route Table defines how network traffic is directed inside your VPC. Each subnet must be 
    associated with exactly one route table.

  * Contains routes mapping a destination 
    CIDR → target (IGW, NAT Gateway, VPC Peering, etc.).

  * Main Route Table → Default for all subnets unless you create and associate a custom one.

  * Public Subnet Example:

      Destination     Target
      0.0.0.0/0       Internet Gateway
      10.0.0.0/16     Local


      Private Subnet Example:

      Destination     Target
      0.0.0.0/0       NAT Gateway
      10.0.0.0/16     Local

4. NAT Gateway -

  * NAT stands for Network Address Translation. A NAT Gateway lets instances in private subnets access
    the internet for outbound connections (e.g., downloading packages), but prevents inbound connections
    from the internet.

  * Placed in a public subnet and connected to an Internet Gateway.

  * Private instances → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway → Internet.

  * NAT Gateway is managed by AWS (scales automatically, highly available in one AZ).

  * You can also use a NAT Instance (EC2 running NAT software), but that’s legacy and not recommended.

  ** Common misconception: NAT Gateway does handle outbound rules; inbound from the internet is 
     blocked unless it’s part of an established outbound session.

5. NACL (Network Access Control List)

  * A NACL is a stateless firewall at the subnet level that controls inbound and outbound traffic.

  * Stateless → Return traffic must be explicitly allowed.

  * Rules are processed in order, from lowest to highest number.

  * Default NACL → Allows all inbound and outbound traffic.

  * Custom NACL → Denies all traffic until rules are added.

  * Works alongside Security Groups (SGs are stateful and operate at the instance level).

  * Best used for blocking certain IP ranges or additional subnet-level security.

  * Example use case: Block all ICMP (ping) requests from a specific IP at the subnet level.

6. VPC Peering -

  * Direct network connection between two VPCs so instances can talk to each other as if they’re 
    in the same network.

  * Works within same region or across regions (inter-region VPC peering).

  * No transitive peering — if A ↔ B and B ↔ C, then A can’t talk to C unless you explicitly peer them.

  * Example:

      You have VPC A (10.0.0.0/16) for frontend apps.

      You have VPC B (172.16.0.0/16) for backend services.

      Peering lets frontend EC2 in A call backend EC2 in B privately.

  * Hands-on:

    Create two VPCs with non-overlapping CIDRs.

    Go to VPC → Peering Connections → Create.

    Accept the connection from the other VPC.

    Update route tables in both VPCs to route to the other’s CIDR through the peering connection.

    Test with ping or curl between instances in each VPC (security group + NACL must allow traffic).
  
  * No overlapping CIDR is allowed.

  * Peering doesn’t support edge-to-edge routing (can’t use peering to access another VPC’s VPN/Direct Connect).

7. Transit Gateway -

  * AWS-managed hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-premise networks easily.
    Think of it like an airport hub for network traffic.

  * Supports transitive routing (VPC A ↔ TGW ↔ VPC B ↔ TGW ↔ VPC C).

  * Can connect VPCs, VPN, Direct Connect, other regions in one place.

  * Example:

      5 VPCs in different AWS accounts all need to communicate.

      Instead of 10+(n*(n-1)/2) peering connections, you attach all VPCs to 1 Transit Gateway.

  * Hands-on:

      Create a Transit Gateway in AWS VPC console.

      Create TGW attachments for each VPC.

      Update route tables in each VPC to send other VPC CIDRs via TGW.

      Test connectivity.

  * Choose Transit Gateway over VPC Peering when > 3 VPCs need full mesh connectivity.

  * TGW supports inter-region peering between TGWs.

8. VPC Flow Logs -

  * Captures network traffic metadata (source/destination IP, ports, accepted/rejected) for VPC, subnet,
    or ENI.

  * Doesn’t capture packet data, just the summary.

  * Example:

      Security group allows traffic, but EC2 isn’t responding.

      You enable VPC Flow Logs and see REJECT logs for NACL — problem solved.

  * Hands-on:

      Go to VPC → Flow Logs → Create.

      Choose VPC / Subnet / ENI.

      Destination: CloudWatch Logs or S3.

      Run network traffic and check logs for ACCEPT/REJECT.

  * Helps in debugging network issues.

  * Flow Logs can be published to S3 or CloudWatch.

  * Not real-time — usually a few minutes delay.

9. VPN ( Virtual Private Network ) -

    * Laptop -> Internet Service Provider ( Airtel ) it can monitor packages

    * Using VPN , it creates secure tunnel between AWS resources and User, so that User can remote and
      securely access the resources within AWS
