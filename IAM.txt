1. Identity Acess Management (IAM) -

    It is a Global service which controls who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform

    Users -

        People within an organization that can use AWS or AWS account for people
        * They do not have permission by default
        * Each user has a unique name and can have CONSOLE access (username/password) or 
         PROGRAMMATIC access(Aws CLI/SDK)
        * Never give user direct permission rather assign permissions via Groups or policies 
        User don't have to belong to a group or it can belong to Multiple groups

    Groups -

        Collection of IAM Users with shared permissions
        * Groups cannot be nested i.e groups cannot contain another groups

    Roles -

        These are temporary permissions to AWS Resources, services or applications
        IAM Roles do not have passwords or access keys

    Policies -

        These are JSON documents that define AWS permissions for Users , Groups or Roles
        It controls what action user or group can perform
        It can be AWS-Managed or Customer-Managed
        * In AWS we follow LEAST PREVILEGE principle i.e don't give more permissions than a user needs
