1. AWS Regions -

    AWS Region is a geographical area that contains multiple Availability Zones AZ.
    Each region operates independently to reduce latency and fault tolerance

    Examples -
        In India we have Asia Pacific (Mumbai), US East
            ap-sount-1 (Mumbai)
            ap-sount-2 (Hyderabad)
            ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
            me-central-1 (UAE - Dubai)

2. Availability Zones (AZs) -

    Each Region has a multiple AZs which are physically separated data centers within that region
    These AZs are connected with low latency networking but are far enough to ensure disaster recovery.
    If one region goes down, other remains functional

    Examples -
        Mumbai region (ap-south-1) has 
            ap-south-1a
            ap-south-1b
            ap-south-1c

3. AWS Data Centers -

    AWS Data centers are physical building where AWS servers and networking equipments are housed
    Each AZ contains one or more data centers

    * Edge locations and AZ contains Data centers which are smaller in size and differs in purpose

4. AWS Edge Locations -

    AWS Edge Locations are data centers used for caching content and reducing latency.
    These are used by AWS CloudFront (CDN), Route 53 etc
    Egde locations in India -
        Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru
